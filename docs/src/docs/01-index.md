Welcome to the cloud.gov design system!

## Principles 


## Purpose

- Document best practices.
- _When, where, why_ and not just _how_ to use these patterns.
- A test bed for prototyping and building new patterns.


## Hierarchy

We use a hierarchy of patterns. Each layer is composed together to form patterns
at each higher layer. Here's an overview of these different patterns.

Together these can be used to prototype how new patterns (or pattern changes)
would affect the app from within the pattern library.


### Base

The low level variables (rules, essentially) that patterns are built from. These
include things like line height, width, color, typography, etc.


### Components

An atomic element that conveys some meaning or concept.


### Features

Complete groups of related functionality, built from components.


### Pages

Complete views built from features.
