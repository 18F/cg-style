# PanelEntry

A `PanelEntry` is a 100% width middle-aligned flex row with a 1px `lightgray` border on the top and bottom. It has a minimum height of `$grid-6`, with `$grid-05` y-padding.

`PanelEntry`s are the standard container component for repeated data in a panel, whether these are activity entries, contents tree entries, services, routes, etc. `PanelEntry` is meant to fit in the `$grid-6` width without resizing. 

You can drop any content into a `PanelEntry` but they work well with standard `Col`s.
